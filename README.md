Coding Test - Station Search

This is a badly written application which follows none of the practices we would look for in a Dev. A candidate should either describe changes they would make or even do some of the changes.

Areas to consider:

- Clean code!
- DI
- Data storage and patterns
- Backend code structure and logic
- Frontend code structure
- Unit testing (TDD/BDD)
- Performance concerns
- Identify needed changes to make it production ready
